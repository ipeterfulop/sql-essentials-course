# Learning session 6

## Topics Overview
Welcome to the 6th learning session of our **SQL Essentials** course!  
In this session Today we will explore the world of set operators, a fundamental tool that allows us to 
seamlessly combine the results of multiple SQL queries. Set operators enable us to perform operations such 
as union, intersection, and difference on datasets, unlocking the ability to extract valuable insights and 
solve complex data challenges efficiently. As we delve into the realm of set operators, you'll discover how to 
merge, compare, and transform data from various tables, paving the way for more advanced query building and data 
analysis techniques.
