# Learning session 7
Welcome to Session 7 of our SQL Essentials Course, titled "Adding, Changing, and Updating Data." 
Get ready to enhance your SQL data manipulation skills!

## 7.1 Topics overview
In this session, we delve into the core of data manipulation in SQL, focusing on three fundamental commands: 
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. These commands form the backbone of 
Data Manipulation Language (DML) and are essential tools for any SQL practitioner.

**INSERT Command:** We'll start by exploring the INSERT command, which is used to add new rows of data to your tables. You'll learn how to insert a single row, multiple rows, and even how to insert data based on the results of a query from another table.

**UPDATE Command:** Next, we'll move on to the UPDATE command. This command is crucial for modifying existing data within your tables. We'll cover how to update data in a single row, multiple rows, and how to use conditions to target specific data sets for updates.

**DELETE Command:** Finally, we'll discuss the DELETE command. This command allows you to remove rows from a table. We'll emphasize the importance of using DELETE with precision and caution, particularly focusing on the use of conditions to avoid unintended data loss.

Throughout this session, we'll reinforce the concepts with practical examples and exercises. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of how to effectively add, modify, and remove data in a database using SQL, equipping you with the skills to manage and maintain your data with confidence and accuracy.
