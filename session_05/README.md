# Learning session 5

## Topics Overview
In this session, we delve into the intricacies of data grouping and aggregation in SQL.     

We begin with   "Aggregate Functions", which are essential in summarizing and analyzing vast amounts of data, 
turning them into digestible metrics like sums, averages, and counts.     

Next, we explore the concept of "Grouping" and its significance in organizing data into meaningful `clusters/groups.    
This leads us to the "GROUP BY" clause, a powerful SQL tool that groups rows sharing a property 
so that an aggregate function can operate on each group.   

Lastly, we'll touch upon "Filtering Aggregate Results", ensuring that our summarized data meets specific criteria, 
further refining our insights.  
**By the end of this session**, participants will be equipped with the knowledge to efficiently group, summarize, 
and filter large datasets.

## Data setup
The tables related to this learning session were created in the ```practice_04``` schema using the script
[`create_tables_practice_05.sql`](data_setup/create_tables_practice_05.sql).  
Tables were populated with data using the script 
[`populate_tables_practice_05.sql`](data_setup/populate_tables_practice_05.sql).
You can use these scripts to create the tables and populate them with data in your own local database.
