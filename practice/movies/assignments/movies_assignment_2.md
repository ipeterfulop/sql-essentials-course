## Assigment O2.1
Show the number of movies per genre for each production company. 
You should only include (production_company, genre) pairs for which there are more than 50 movies.  
Sort the results by the name of the genre alphabetically and by the number of movies in descending order.   
**Hint:** You can start by creating a CTE that calculates the number of movies per genre 
for each production company. To effectuate this, you can join the ```movie_genres``` table with the ```movie``` and 
```movie_company``` tables.
As a final step, you can join the CTE with the ```genre``` and ```production_company``` tables to get the names of the genres

## Assigment O2.2
List the name of the person who played in more than one movie with Anthony Hopkins.  
Use the ```select person_id from person where person_name = 'Anthony Hopkins'``` query to get the ```person_id``` of Anthony Hopkins.
**Hint:**

- You can start by creating a CTE that collects the ```movie_id```s of the movies in which Anthony Hopkins played. 
- Then, you can join the CTE with the ```movie_cast``` and ```person``` tables to get the names of the persons 
who played in the same movies as Anthony Hopkins.
- Finally, you can group the results by ```person_id``` and ```person_name``` and count the number of movies in which each person played.
- Do not forget to exclude Anthony Hopkins from the results.
