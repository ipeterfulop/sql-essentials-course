## Topics Overview
In our fourth session, we will dive deep into the intricate world of **subqueries**, 
a powerful tool in database management and querying.  
`Subqueries`, often nestled within a larger query, can be both correlated and non-correlated, 
each with its unique characteristics and applications. 
We'll explore how to `embed subqueries within various segments of a SQL statement`, 
including the WHERE clause, FROM clause, and even within INNER JOINs.  
Additionally, we'll demystify the concept of `derived tables` and 
their role in optimizing database operations. 
To ensure you're equipped with a holistic understanding, 
we'll also discuss the best scenarios for employing subqueries and, equally important, 
situations where their use might not be the most efficient approach. 

## Data setup
The tables related to this learning session were created in the ```practice_04``` schema using the script
[`create_tables_practice_04.sql`](data_setup/create_tables_practice_04.sql).  
Tables were populated with data using the script 
[`populate_tables_practice_04.sql`](data_setup/populate_tables_practice_04.sql).
You can use these scripts to create the tables and populate them with data in your own local database.

## Homework assignment
The homework assignment for this session can be found 
[homework_04.sql](homework_04.sql) and must be submitted prior to the next session.
